# Welcome to My Personal Collection of Theological Insights and Esoteric Explorations

Hello everyone,

I want to share with you all a couple of links to resources that are very close to my heart. These aren't just any documents; they're a culmination of my journey through faith, scripture, and the unexplained mysteries that fascinate us. As a long-time believer and someone who's read the Bible from cover to cover multiple times and spent years immersed in the world of theology and esoteric themes, I believe I've gathered insights that could shed light on many of the questions we ponder.

### [The Cosmic Christian Story](https://github.com/EliTime/Christian-Docs/blob/main/Cosmic%20Christian%20Story%20Final%201.24.2024.docx) (Download Raw File)

Here, I've tried to bridge the gap between traditional Christian beliefs, the curiosity around New Age thought, and the allure of conspiracy theories. This book is my attempt to explore the complex and often misunderstood aspects of our reality, all through the lens of scripture and with the Holy Spirit as our guide. While the subjects tackled may not all be essential for salvation, they offer a unique perspective on biblical answers to challenging questions. It's my personal invitation to you to explore these themes with an open mind and heart.

_Status: Rough draft pretty much complete, small changes will be made._

## Invitation to Explore

I'm sharing these links as an invitation to those among you seeking answers to the myriad questions that intrigue and challenge us—topics that span magic, the New Age, the Nephilim, other gods, Christianity, the purpose of life, the nature of suffering, the significance of sin, the identity of Christ, and the true essence of what the Bible holds.

Too often, mainstream Christian circles shy away from these subjects, to their detriment. And regrettably, many don't engage with the Bible directly or seek answers from God on their own. My intention in making these resources available is to bridge that gap, offering insights that I've found transformative in my own journey as a long-time believer, a devotee of scripture, and an enthusiast keen on unraveling the complexities and esoteric truths of our existence.

My hope is that within these pages, you'll find insights that resonate, bring clarity, or ignite further curiosity in your quest for understanding.

_These resources are continually updated as I add more content and refine my thoughts. Feel free to dive in and explore._
